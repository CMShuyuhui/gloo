    description: >
      Fix memory leak in active (event-heavy) kubernetes environments which could lead to Gloo pods
      (gloo, discovery, gateway) memory usage growing without bounds by ignoring update events where the new/old
      resource is unchanged, which significantly helps Gloo keep pace with the pace of incoming events at
      steady-state.
